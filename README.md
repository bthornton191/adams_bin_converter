# Adams Bin Converter

## New Features in v0.0.2
1. Added feature to recognize version in bin file.
2. Added feature to get multiple models out of a single .bin file

## Installation

### Option 1: Download the standalone script
1. Download the code base as a zip file using the green **Code** button above.
3. Extract **adams_bin_converter.py**


### Option 2: Install with pip
```
> pip install git+https://github.com/bthornton191/adams_bin_converter
```

## Command Line Usage
Convert a **.bin** file to a **.cmd** file using the following command line syntax:
```bash
> python adams_bin_converter.py file_1.bin
```
You may convert multiple **.bin** files like so:
```bash
> python adams_bin_converter.py file_1.bin file_2.bin
```
Use the following syntax **if you installed via pip**.
```bash
> python -m adams_bin_converter file1.bin
```
> Note: The newly created command file will be named after the model contained by the .bin file. 
> If the .bin file contains **multiple models** then the program will create muiltiple .cmd files.

### Letting the program find the path to the correct mdi.bat file based on the .bin file version
In order for this to work you must tell the script where all of your adams installations are 
located (e.g. C:/Program Files/MSC.Software/Adams). Adams will look for this location in the 
following order:
1. The `ADAMS_INSTALL_DIR` variable at the top of the module
2. A `ADAMS_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable

### Specifying the path to the mdi.bat file as an argument
There are several options for telling **adams_bin_converter.py** which installation of adams to use. 
The simplest is supplying the path as an argument to the command line interface. You can do this 
using the `--p` flag.
```bash
> python adams_bin_converter.py --p "C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\Adams\2021_2_2_826892\common\mdi.bat" file_1.bin
```
> Note: The `--p` flag overrides the above method. However, if a valid mdi.bat file is not provided, 
> the program will revert to determining the correct mdi.bat file based on the version of the .bin
> files.

### Specifying the path to the mdi.bat file using a module variable

You can also permenantly specify the path to the mdi.bat file by setting the `ADAMS_LAUNCH_COMMAND` 
variable in the top of the **adams_bin_converter.py**. The head of **adams_bin_converter.py** is shown below.
```python
import os
import argparse
from pathlib import Path
from random import random
import subprocess
import platform
from time import sleep

SCRIPT_NAME = '_bin_converter.py'
ADAMS_LAUNCH_COMMAND = Path('<adams_install_dir>/<version_dir>/common/mdi.bat')

...
```
To permentantly set the path to the mdi.bat file you would change the line
```python
ADAMS_LAUNCH_COMMAND = Path('<adams_install_dir>/<version_dir>/common/mdi.bat')
```
to
```python
ADAMS_LAUNCH_COMMAND = Path('C:/Program Files/MSC.Software/Adams/2021_2_2_826892/common/mdi.bat')
# NOTE: You must use forward slashes (/) or double back slashes (\\) in the file path above.
```
> Note: The program will attempt all methods above before trying this method

### Specifying the path to the mdi.bat file using an environment variable
You can permentantly specify the path to the mdi.bat file by setting the `ADAMS_LAUNCH_COMMAND` 
environment variable using the following syntax:
```bash
> setx ADAMS_LAUNCH_COMMAND "C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\Adams\2021_2_2_826892\common\mdi.bat"
```
> Note: The program will attempt all methods above before trying this method

## API Usage
You can accomplish the same tasks from within a python script as follows:
```python
from adams_bin_converter import convert

convert('path/bin_files/file_1.bin')
```
You can use the same methods described above to specify the path to the mdi.bat file. For instance
you can pass the path as an argument to the `convert` function like so:
```python
convert(
    bin_file = 'path/bin_files/file_1.bin',
    adams_launch_command = 'C:/Program Files/MSC.Software/Adams/2021_2_2_826892/common/mdi.bat'
)
```
